    ptsname is not there.

    * Pty.pm: v0.97_01; updated docs 

    * Makefile.PL: v0.97_01; auto-create IO::Tty::Constant

2002-01-31   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Pty.pm: add IO::Stty to @ISA, master pty is sometimes a tty.

    * Tty.pm: v0.95_01

2002-01-30   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Tty.pm, Pty.pm: v0.94_05

    * Tty.xs (allocate_pty): moved getpt() and openpty() before muxes

    * test.pl: if master isatty, set it also to raw; seems to be needed.

    * Makefile.PL: fixed checks; test problematic constants with a compile.
    
2002-01-23   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Tty.pm: v0.94_03

    * test.pl: changed test to probe for maximum chunk the pty can
    handle; also, the /dev/tty test probes if an EOF is correctly
    reported from the child to the parent.

    * Tty.xs: finally made debug printfs optional via $IO::Tty::DEBUG.

2002-01-18   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Tty.pm: v0.94_02

    * Tty.xs: added #include termio.h

    (close_slave): added for keeping open filecount straight
    (make_slave_controlling_terminal): created anew
    (slave): reverted from open_slave()

    * Tty.pm: v0.94_01

    * test.pl: adapted to new interface

    * Tty.xs: reverted to opening slave at creation time; added debug
    printfs
    (open_slave): use ptsname_r if there, forget about erroneous ttyname.
    (allocate_pty): added name param on openpty (doesn't take NULL for name)
    
2001-11-28   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Tty.pm: v0.92_04

    * Tty.xs (BOOT): use perl_get_sv for backward compat

    * Makefile.PL: added analysis of configuration

2001-11-27   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Tty.pm: v0.92_03

    * Tty.xs (BOOT): removed export_fail, undefined constants are now
    undef instead of not exportable; added CONFIG variable.

    * Makefile.PL: added setting of CONFIG var

    * test.pl: added printing of CONFIG var

    * Pty.pm (spawn): fixed bug with $^W handling

2001-11-17   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Tty.xs (pty_allocate): complete rewrite, based on ideas from
    openssh and Xemacs.  Tries all ways detected by Makefile.PL in
    order, so in theory it should work everywhere (modulo system
    quirks).  First tries the high-level openpty() before getpt(),
    then various clone devices and finally BSD-style ptys.

    * Tty.xs (open_slave): moved master init stuff here, must be done
    before opening the slave.  The Stream module pushes are now tried
    on all systems but only generate warnings on systems that we know
    need them.

    * Makefile.PL: added tests for all kinds of functions and clone
    devices.
    
2001-11-14   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Tty.xs (MODULE): stole creation code from openssh

    * test.pl: added test for controlling terminal

    * Pty.pm (spawn): rearranged setsid() and added a fresh open of
    the slave pty so the pty becomes the controlling terminal for the
    process.

2001-10-25   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Pty.pm (spawn): copied spawning process from Tcl/Expect (thanks,
      Don!); should set the controlling tty so ssh and other password
      requesting programs should be OK; also now returns exec errors.
      (slave_pid): added method to get at PID of spawned process.

    * Makefile.PL: added TIOCCONS.

    * try: adapted to use spawn().

    * test.pl: adapted to use spawn(); added test for exec errors.

2001-10-16  Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * Pty.pm (new): fixed bad my() line

    * automatically add IO::Stty to ISA if it exists.

2001-07-16  Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

    * test.pl: finally some tests!  Spawns a perl mini-script that
      echoes back all characters from STDIN, but inverted.

    * Pty.pm (slave): slave now is set to be a controlling tty if possible;
      it also remembers it's name now.

    * Makefile.PL: 
      - on SCO, the slave pts* are in the /dev dir, not /dev/pts
      - added test for libutil.h, util.h, pty.h and openpty()
      - added symbol TIOCSCTTY

    * Tty.xs:
      - some SVR4 only define __SVR4; fixed.
      - OSF machines need termio.h for various macros
      - AIX doesn't define VOIDSIG; fixed.
      - Cygwin can use /dev/ptmx even though that file doesn't exist.
      - added openpty() version for FreeBSD and others that have 
        no good method for creating ptys; untested.

    * Tty.pm:
      - moved docu over from Pty.pm to lessen confusion Pty <-> Tty
      - added verified systems list
    
Change 588 on 2000/09/04 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

    Check for /dev/ptmx and /dev/pts instead of testing defined(SVR4)

Change 587 on 2000/09/04 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

    Make ttyname just warn when it is not implemented instead of croak

Change 586 on 2000/09/04 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

    Include <sys/modem.h> for HPUX

Change 585 on 2000/09/04 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

    Makefile.PL
    - Fix to how cc is called

Change 461 on 2000/03/29 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

    Release 0.03

Change 460 on 2000/03/29 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

    General cleanup and added PPD stuff into Makefile.PL

Change 310 on 1999/05/10 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

    - Removed the need for Configure by implementing a test in Makefile.PL
    - The existance of constants are now checked at import time, so @EXPORT
      had to be renamed to @EXPORT_OK. ie noting is imported by default
